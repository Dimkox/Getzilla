# Requirements — Remove predecessor name from the freeze digest comment

> Typed authority: [`change-spec.yaml`](change-spec.yaml). This Markdown explains context and cannot override typed IDs, risk, acceptance criteria, forbidden outcomes, or approval scopes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] test_no_predecessor_product_names_in_live_files passes.
- [x] test_landing_api digests and assertions are unchanged and pass.

## Failure and edge cases

- The identity scan covers comments in tests.

## Governance context

Canonical governance JSON under `governance/` remains separately reviewed authority. Any rule, example, debt, or digest named here is non-authoritative context until the verifier rederives current governance evidence.

- Applicable rule IDs: none.
- Canonical-example deviations and evidence: none.
- Intentional debt created, repaid, or accepted: none.

## Non-functional requirements

- Security: unchanged.
- Reliability: unchanged.
- Performance: unchanged.
- Observability: unchanged.
